Question: If a train travels at 60 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, how far does it travel?
Reasoning: To find the distance traveled by the train, we can use the formula: 

Distance = Speed × Time

Here, the speed of the train is 60 miles per hour and the time traveled is 2.5 hours. 

So, we calculate:

Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 150 miles
Answer: 150.0 miles

Question: Sarah has 5 apples. She buys 7 more apples from the store. How many apples does Sarah have now?
Reasoning: To find out how many apples Sarah has now, we need to add the number of apples she originally had to the number of apples she bought. Sarah starts with 5 apples and buys 7 more. Therefore, the total number of apples is calculated as follows: 

5 (original apples) + 7 (bought apples) = 12 apples.
Answer: 12.0 apples

Question: Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum equals two?
Reasoning: When two dice are tossed, each die has 6 faces, resulting in a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes. The only way to achieve a sum of 2 is if both dice show a 1 (i.e., (1,1)). There is only 1 favorable outcome for this event. Therefore, the probability of the sum equaling 2 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 1/36.
