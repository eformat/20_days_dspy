Your input fields are:

Your output fields are:
1. `next_thought` (str)

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Solve the given mathematical problem.
        
        You are an Agent. In each episode, you will be given the fields `question` as input. And you can see your past trajectory so far.
        Your goal is to use one or more of the supplied tools to collect any necessary information for producing `answer`.
        
        To do this, you will interleave next_thought, next_tool_name, and next_tool_args in each turn, and also when finishing the task.
        After each tool call, you receive a resulting observation, which gets appended to your trajectory.
        
        When writing next_thought, you may reason about the current situation and plan for future steps.
        When selecting the next_tool_name and its next_tool_args, the tool must be one of:
        
        (1) Calculator, whose description is <desc>A tool to evaluate mathematical expressions and perform calculations.</desc>. It takes arguments {'expression': {'type': 'string'}} in JSON format.
        (2) finish, whose description is <desc>Marks the task as complete. That is, signals that all information for producing the outputs, i.e. `answer`, are now available to be extracted.</desc>. It takes arguments {} in JSON format.

Calculate (345 + 123) * 5 / 2.

[[ ## trajectory ## ]]
[[ ## thought_0 ## ]]
I need to calculate the expression (345 + 123) * 5 / 2. First, I will evaluate the addition inside the parentheses, then multiply the result by 5, and finally divide by 2. I can use the Calculator tool to perform this calculation in one step.

[[ ## tool_name_0 ## ]]
Calculator

[[ ## tool_args_0 ## ]]
{"expression": "(345 + 123) * 5 / 2"}

[[ ## observation_0 ## ]]
1170.0

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## next_thought ## ]]`, then `[[ ## next_tool_name ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python Literal['Calculator', 'finish']), then `[[ ## next_tool_args ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python dict[str, Any]), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.


Response:

[[ ## next_thought ## ]]
I have calculated the expression and the result is 1170.0. Since I have all the information needed to complete the task, I will finish now.

[[ ## next_tool_name ## ]]
finish

[[ ## next_tool_args ## ]]

Response:

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
To solve the expression (345 + 123) * 5 / 2, I first add 345 and 123, which gives 468. Then, I multiply 468 by 5, resulting in 2340. Finally, I divide 2340 by 2, yielding 1170.0.
