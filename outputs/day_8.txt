The question asks for an actress who has two specific qualifications: she acted in the short film "The Shore" and is the youngest actress to play Ophelia in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of "Hamlet." From the context provided, it is noted that Kerry Condon is the youngest actress to play Ophelia in a Royal Shakespeare Company production. However, the context does not provide information about her involvement in "The Shore." Therefore, I need to search for the cast of "The Shore" to confirm if Kerry Condon is part of it or if there is another actress who meets both criteria.
