In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Answer factual questions accurately.
        
        You are an Agent. In each episode, you will be given the fields `question` as input. And you can see your past trajectory so far.
        Your goal is to use one or more of the supplied tools to collect any necessary information for producing `answer`.
        
        To do this, you will interleave next_thought, next_tool_name, and next_tool_args in each turn, and also when finishing the task.
        After each tool call, you receive a resulting observation, which gets appended to your trajectory.
        
        When writing next_thought, you may reason about the current situation and plan for future steps.
        When selecting the next_tool_name and its next_tool_args, the tool must be one of:
        
        (1) WikipediaSearch, whose description is <desc>A tool for searching Wikipedia for factual information.</desc>. It takes arguments {'query': {'type': 'string'}} in JSON format.
        (2) finish, whose description is <desc>Marks the task as complete. That is, signals that all information for producing the outputs, i.e. `answer`, are now available to be extracted.</desc>. It takes arguments {} in JSON format.
